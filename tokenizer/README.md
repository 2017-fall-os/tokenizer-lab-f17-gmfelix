Welcome to my tokenizer!

A tokenizer is a utility that serves the purpose of separating a string into different tokens, given a delimiter and a string.

How to compile:
In order to run the tokenizer, move to the directory containing the makefile and then run the following commands:
-make all
-make run

Once these commands have been input, the interface will appear

How to operate:
There are two special words for this tokenizer
1.- Test
  Runs the test cases provided in the lab description at https://sites.google.com/site/theoryofoperatingsystems/labs/tokenizer
  (Please note, there will be a lot of info displayed, so prepare for a bit of spam!)
2.- Exit
  This command serves as the main exit for the program, if this command appears, the process will stop.

Now that you know all the special words, the use of the regular tokenizer is straight forward, just input a string that you would like to tokenize, once this has been entered, you will be prompted for a delimiter, this can be any character or word.
Once these two have been provided, the tokenizer will print each word separately and will prompt again for another string and another delimiter.
The special words mentioned above only work when the tokenizer is asking for a string, not when it's asking for a delimiter

Thanks for using my tokenizer and have a good day!
